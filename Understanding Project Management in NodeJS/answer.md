Understanding Project Management in Node.js

This document explains how project management works in Node.js backend applications. It covers package managers, NPM, project initialization, and important files created during setup.

a. Package Managers
What is a package manager?

A package manager is a tool that helps developers install, update, remove, and manage external libraries (packages).

These libraries contain reusable code written by other developers.

In Node.js, the most common package manager is NPM.

Why do we need package managers in backend development?

Backend projects depend on many external libraries such as frameworks, databases, and utilities.

Package managers:

Save development time

Ensure consistency across environments

Automatically handle library versions

Simplify project setup for teams

Example: Instead of writing authentication logic from scratch, we can install a ready-made package.

Problems faced if package managers are not used

Developers must manually download and manage libraries

Version conflicts between team members

Difficult project setup on new machines

Hard to track which library version is being used

Increased chances of bugs and deployment issues

b. NPM (Node Package Manager)
What is NPM?

NPM is the default package manager for Node.js.

It provides access to thousands of open-source packages.

NPM is installed automatically when Node.js is installed.

Why is NPM important for Node.js applications?

It allows easy installation of libraries like Express, Mongoose, Axios, etc.

It manages project dependencies efficiently.

It helps in running scripts for development and production.

How NPM helps in managing dependencies

Dependencies are listed in the package.json file.

NPM installs exact versions to avoid breaking changes.

Automatically installs dependencies using a single command:

npm install
c. Backend Project Initialization
Command used to initialize a Node.js project
npm init
What does npm init do?

Starts an interactive setup process.

Asks questions like project name, version, entry file, etc.

Creates a package.json file based on the answers.

What does npm init -y do?

Automatically creates package.json with default values.

Skips all questions.

Useful for quick project setup.

d. Files and Folders Created After Project Initialization
package.json

Acts as the configuration file for the project.

Stores:

Project metadata

Installed dependencies

Scripts

Required to run and manage the project.

node_modules

Contains all installed dependencies.

Automatically generated by NPM.

Can be very large in size.

package-lock.json

Stores exact versions of installed dependencies.

Ensures consistent installs across different systems.

Prevents version mismatch issues.

GitHub Best Practices
Files/Folders that should NOT be pushed to GitHub

node_modules

Very large in size

Can be recreated using npm install

Files that MUST be committed to GitHub

package.json

Defines project dependencies

package-lock.json

Ensures consistent dependency versions

Source code files

Conclusion

Proper project management in Node.js using NPM ensures clean, scalable, and maintainable backend applications. Understanding these basics is essential for working in real-world development teams.
